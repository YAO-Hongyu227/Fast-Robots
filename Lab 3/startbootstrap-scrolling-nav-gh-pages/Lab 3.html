                        <p class="lead">Demonstrate that your board can capture at least 5s worth of IMU data and send it over Bluetooth to the computer.</p>
                        
                        <p></p>
                        <p style="font-weight: normal">The figure below shows how the arduino is collecting, storing and sending IMU data. It also gives instruction about how our computer could receive the data using callback function in jupyter notebook. And we can notice that the IMU data are fully collected, stored, sent and received since the data printed in the jupyter notebook are also has a 3ms interval.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight: normal">Here below shows the full results for the 5s data, it could be very long and you may just skip.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: normal">This is the end of this Lab! </p>
